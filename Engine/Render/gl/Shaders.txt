What is a Shader?

A shader at is simplest is a chunk of code that gets run on the graphics processing unit (GPU) instead of on the central processing
unit (CPU). Both the CPU and GPU are made up of cores, which is where the processing is actually done, and each CPU core is much
faster, more powerful, and more versitile than a GPU core.

Why do we want to run code on the GPU instead of the CPU?

The GPU has hundreds of cores we as the CPU only has a handfull this means the GPU excels at doing lots of things all at once.
The most common use for shaders is to do all the calculations involved with displaying things on the screen and this usally done
in 2 stages with a Vertex Shader and Fragment Shader, which is sometimes called a Pixel Shader.

We still need to run code on the CPU to use Shaders. To draw 3D shape on the screen the code on the CPU will pass the GPU a list
of all the points or vertices that define the surface of the shape we want to draw. The Vertex Shader takes these points and 
figures out where they should appear on the screen, and then the Fragment Shader figures out what color each spot on the surface
of that object should be. There are other types of shaders with specific use-cases as well such as Geomtery and Compute Shaders.

We have to use a special programming laungage called GLSL. When you create a new varible in GLSL you have to tell the varible
what type of varible it is and you can't change it once it is set.
